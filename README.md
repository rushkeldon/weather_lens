# WeatherLens

#### Displays current weather conditions and 5-day forecast for the selected location using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/poweredby/) and the Google Map Geolocation API

## Where?

#### You can see WeatherLens running at [spiral9.com/weatherlens](http://spiral9.com/weatherlens)

## Why?

* A coding challenge for an interview
* To demonstrate Angular, HTML, JS, LESS, Gulp, Bower, and Node chops

## How To Build?

### Prerequisites (and version(s) are known to work): 

* Node v 5.6.0

### From the command line from project dir :

1. ``` $ npm install ```
2. ``` $ gulp ```
3. open the newly created 'build' directory and open index.html in your favorite browser

## What are the project's known TODOs?

1. unit tests - I haven't written any yet!!
2. On chrome on iOS the title bar of the browser doesn't disappear with scrolling as the scrolling is happening in the MAIN element as opposed to the body - it would be good to fix that (particularly in landscape!)
